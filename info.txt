welcome to zeroZ! here a preview of the code will do:
to print use: println() you can use println("Hello world!") to print just "",
if want print only a varible use println(x) will print just x or any varible name,
to print both use '{}'  and put the varible inside like: println("hello {name}, you are {age} old!") with can be any varibles name on {} and strings on ""

to define varible use:
name:type = value
with can be any varible name, and value depeding on the type, 
all the types:
int, float/doble, char and string, you don't need write any especial carater to value like:
name:string = "value" 
here just use:
name:string = value

also it have functions can use:
function name(args){body} and function call: name(args) 

also it have if elses, else if is currently not working, can use:
if(args){body}

comparators have:
>, <, >=, <=, == !=, still don't have logic gates like and, or, xor, etc, but will add it soon

also it includes input() with as sayed, will pick the value and print, currently only works on varible:
age:int = input()
you can add "" on () so:
age:int = input("your age: ")
and on the console/terminal:
your age:
.

to run use on this file python main.py filename.py, in the future will make zeroz filename.zz and allow can be in other location,
also have a example code on example.zz, can run it using: python main.py example.zz

if have any ideas please comment it, or fork it
